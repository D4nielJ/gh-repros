# Github Repros

Repros is a project that connects with the official GitHub API and allows the user to search himself or others with a proper Github Username.

> Search yourself or others and find relevant information about your repos.
> Click on the titles to be redirected to the oficial GitHub pages.

This is the capstone project for the React-Redux modules.

All of the actions made by the user are handle by reducers and update internal and universal states of the app.
